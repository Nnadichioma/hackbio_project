# Bone Marrow Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a human **bone marrow single-cell RNA-seq dataset** (`bone_marrow.h5ad`) to identify cell populations, quantify cell type proportions, and annotate clusters using canonical markers. The analysis leverages **Scanpy** and **Decoupler** for preprocessing, clustering, visualization, and cell type scoring.

**Biological Questions:**
1. Which cell types are present in the dataset?
2. What are the biological roles of each identified cell type?
3. Can we map major hematopoietic and immune cell populations in bone marrow?
4. Can we assess patient health status based on immune cell composition?

|---------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0       | Neutrophils        | Phagocytose pathogens, innate defense                                   |
| 1       | Monocytes          | Differentiate into macrophages/DCs, mediate inflammation                |
| 2       | Gamma delta T cells| Early responders to stressed/infected cells without MHC                |
| 3       | Gamma delta T cells| Same as above                                                           |
| 4       | T memory cells     | Adaptive immune cells; respond to previously encountered antigens       |
| 5       | NK cells           | Kill virus-infected or transformed cells                                |

| 7       | B cells memory     | Produce antibodies upon re-exposure                                     |
| 8       | Platelets          | Clotting and wound healing, derived from megakaryocytes                 |
| 9       | Plasma cells       | Terminal B cells secreting antibodies                                   |

## Tissue Source Justification
Evidence supporting **bone marrow origin**:

- Presence of **neutrophils** and **platelets**, absent in PBMC preps.  
- Diverse **mature hematopoietic lineages**: T cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes, plasma cells.  

**Exceptions:**  
- Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and erythroid progenitors were not detected.  
- Likely due to low abundance or sampling bias, but overall lineage composition supports marrow origin.

> **Conclusion:** Sample is consistent with bone marrow, with some progenitors likely underrepresented.

## Patient Health Assessment
| Cell Type           | Percent of Total Cells |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| T memory cells      | 28.05%               |
| Gamma delta T cells | 18.76% + 8.88%      |
| NK cells            | 11.97%               |
| Neutrophils         | 8.03%                |
| B cells memory      | 7.32%                |
| Monocytes           | 5.50%                |
| Plasma cells        | 4.76%                |
| Platelets           | 1.28%                |

**Interpretation:**  
- Elevated **T memory cells** and **NK cells** indicate adaptive and innate immune activation.  
- Moderate neutrophils and monocytes reflect active inflammation.  
- Presence of B cells and plasma cells suggests ongoing antibody-mediated response.  

> **Conclusion:** Patient shows signs of **infection or active immune response**, not a healthy baseline.
